Associated high clouds have provided some effect \non temps, however strong warm advection has won out with gusts in \nupwards of 25 mph. High temps remain on track to reach the upper 50s \nand lower 60s. As the sfc low exits this evening, winds should calm \nand become light from the northwest.  \n\nThe first anomalously strong system, currently rotating just off the \nsouthern CA coastline, will bring much needed rainfall to the region \nafter midnight through Tuesday afternoon.  Guidance continues to be \nin good agreement in the track and location of higher precip \namounts, lending to the definite pops mentioned Tuesday after \nsunrise. EFI and GEFS ensembles continue to indicate high PWAT \nvalues well above the climatological norms at 0.8 to 1 inches. \nOverall precip amounts were not changed with widespread totals from \na half inch to 1 inch. Winds are also of concern Monday night into \nTuesday afternoon with southerly speeds approaching advisory \ncriteria of 20 to 30 mph sustained. These winds remain stout at \naround 25 mph as they shift towards the west Tuesday evening. The \nprimary uncertainty to mention is the amount of mid level \ninstability that develops Tuesday morning and afternoon. Lapse rates \nwould be steep in the vicinity of the cold upper low so still cannot \nrule out a few afternoon thunderstorms.\n\nThe second, possibly more impactful storm system is progged to \narrive Wednesday early evening through Thursday morning. Overall \noperational and ensemble guidance is beginning to trend the track \nof the upper low slightly further south due to a northern stream \ntrough deepening further south across the Great Lakes region. This\nscenario would shift the sfc low towards southern OK and \ntherefore the higher precip amounts further south into central and\nnortheast Kansas. The 0C surface temps would also spread further \nsouth at a faster rate, allowing more snow to fall as oppose to \nrain early Thursday morning. Accumulating snow remains most likely\ntowards north central Kansas, however areas near the I-70 \ncorridor could end up seeing a few inches of snow as well. An \nimpressive pressure gradient is shaping up to be likely area wide \nas northerly winds could gust in excess of 30 mph, resulting in \nblowing snow, reduced visibilities, and hazardous travel. If \nconfidence continues to increase as models mostly remain on track,\na Winter Storm Watch will likely be needed for portions of north \ncentral and northeast Kansas.\n\nAnticipate bitterly cold temps behind the front Thursday and Friday \nmornings with wind chill readings from the single digits to 10 \ndegrees below zero. After highs in the 20s on Thursday, a quick \nwarmup should melt much of the snow with highs back in the 50s by \nSaturday.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION...(For the 00Z TAFS through 00Z Monday evening)\nIssued at 532 PM CST Sun Feb 12 2023\n\nExpect VFR conditions for the next 24 hours. A weak cold front\nwill switch winds to the northwest after 2Z MON, but speeds will\nremain below 10 KTS. Northwest winds will become light and\nvariable after 12Z MON, then become southerly late Monday\nafternoon.\n\n&&\n\n.TOP WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\nNONE.\n&&\n\n$$\n\nDISCUSSION...22\nAVIATION...Gargan\n"
