A weak\ncold front then moves through Monday night. High pressure builds\nback in for Tuesday and slides offshore Wednesday. A warm front\nlifts through the region on Thursday, with the associated cold \nfront following on Friday. High pressure returns for next \nweekend.\n\n&&\n\n.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM MONDAY MORNING/...\nCloudy tonight with low pressure approaching from the south. \nRain will continue to overspread srn and ern areas. Thermal \nprofiles support rain. The only outside chance of a wintry mix \nwould be over interior SE CT where wet-bulbing could cause the \nthermal profile to cool, but overall chances here for any precip\nare low as there's plenty of dry low to mid level air to \novercome. Rain amounts will be light as the area will be on the \nnorthern periphery of the rain shield.\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM /6 AM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...\nThe center of the the storm will be passing SE of the 40N/70W \nbenchmark Monday morning. The back edge of the rain shield will be \nexiting east probably before daybreak, so only low chances of rain \nearly on for the Twin Forks/New London County area. Clearing skies \notherwise, with high temperatures around 10 degrees above normal.\n\nA trough aloft shifts through the region during Monday night with a \nsurface cold front or trough shifting through. Moisture is limited, \nso will go with a dry passage in the forecast. It'll turn breezy \nbehind the front late at night, helping to produce wind chills \nmostly in the mid 20s to lower 30s.\n\n&&\n\n.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...\nA quick moving trough over New England early Tuesday swings offshore \nearly Tuesday, with ridging developing across the Eastern US into \nmidweek. At the surface, high pressure quickly moves overhead on \nTuesday, sliding offshore Tuesday night and setting up return \nsoutherly flow midweek.\n\nA storm system cutting through the Upper Midwest passes well to the \nnorth on Wednesday as ridging continues to build aloft. A weak warm \nfront lifts through on Wednesday, and a 50 kt LLJ at 925 mb may \nallow a few southerly wind gusts around 30 mph to mix down to the \nsurface. Moisture is limited and expect conditions to remain dry, \nthough skies may go overcast for a period with a high cloud deck \noverhead.\n\n850 mb temperature anomalies climb to +10C to +15C Wednesday and \nThursday with a mild SW flow. Went with a blend of NBM 50% and 75% \npercentiles for highs on Thursday given the potential to overachieve \nwith 12Z run of NAEFS, forecast temperatures +2 to +3 standard \ndeviations above normal during this time. This yields forecast highs \nclose to 60 both days, or about 20 degrees above climatology.\n\nPressure gradient begins to tighten on Thursday ahead of the next \napproaching storm system from the west. Timing has moved up a bit \nfrom previous cycles, with the warm front now progged to lift \nthrough the region Thursday, and the attendant cold front on Friday.\nTemperatures may hold steady, or even rise, overnight into Friday as \nthe region lies in the warm sector of the system. Scattered rain \nshowers are likely along the warm front on Thursday, with another \nperiod of rain Thursday night into Friday ahead of the cold front. \nSeveral weak waves of low pressure may also attempt to slide along \nthe front as well, enhancing the available moisture content. Could \nsee some brief heavy rain with the cold front early Friday and may \nhave to watch for any potential stronger wind gusts than forecast \nbeing brought down by the frontal showers. Showalter indices stay \npositive enough to preclude mention of any thunder.\n\nBehind the frontal passage, winds veer northwest and colder air \nadvects in and brings a brief return to temperatures more \nappropriate for mid-February. Depending on the timing of the cold \nfront, temperatures may fall through the afternoon Friday, with the \nentire region below freezing Friday night and Saturday morning. \nEnsembles continue to prog the incoming air mass as seasonable, \nrather than any anomalously cool or sustained cold. With the \nexceptions noted above, stuck close to national blended guidance for \nthis update.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION /03Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...\nAn area of low pressure passes south of the terminals tonight \ninto early Monday.\n\nMainly VFR through the TAF period. \n\nLight rain will impact srn and ern arpts thru around 6Z. There\ncould be a few MVFR pockets, but the prob was too low to include\nin the TAFs.\n\nOnce the low passes east of the area Monday morning, skies are\nexpected to clear for Monday afternoon. \n\nWith the low passing nearby, winds will gradually shift through much \nof the entire period. E winds become more northerly tngt, and \neventually during the day Monday, northwesterly and westerly. \nSpeeds will generally remain at or below 10kt, except further \nwest where speeds could reach 12 or 13kt. KGON may even see some\ngusts late in the TAF period. \n\n ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...\n\nSome periods of MVFR possible thru about 6Z.\n\nOUTLOOK FOR 00Z TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...\n\nMonday Night...VFR. NW winds 15-20 kt. \n\nTuesday...VFR. NW winds gusts near 20 kt, mainly in the morning.\nGusts diminish late afternoon into the night.\n\nWednesday...Mainly VFR. S-SW winds 15-20 kt with gusts near \n25-30 kt.\n\nThursday...MVFR and rain showers possible, mainly afternoon \ninto the evening. SW winds 5-10G15-20\n\nThursday night/Friday...Rain showers become likely and \ncontinuing into Friday morning. MVFR or lower likely. \nSW gusts 25-30 kt Friday morning.\n\nDetailed information, including hourly TAF wind component forecasts, \ncan be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...\nA low pressure system sliding to the south of the area tonight into \nMonday will bring SCA conditions to the ocean waters tonight through \nMonday night. A few gusts to 25 kt will be possible tonight over the \neasternmost portion of LI Sound.\n\nA few 25 kt gusts are possible Tuesday morning before lowering \nbelow SCA criteria, though ocean seas may linger around 4 to 6 \nft into Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSCA conditions likely return to all waters Wednesday with southerly \nwinds gusting 25 to 30 kt during the afternoon. The flow lightens \nWednesday night, before increasing once again late Thursday. A \nperiod of gales is possible, particularly on the ocean, Thursday \nnight through Friday night with a frontal system moving through the \nwaters. Seas on the ocean likely peak at 7 to 10 ft during this time.\n\nWinds decrease on all waters Saturday, but seas may continue \nto linger around 5 ft on the ocean.\n\n&&\n\n.HYDROLOGY...\nNo hydrologic impacts are expected through the middle of the\nweek. Brief heavy rain possible early Friday but with fast \nmovement. At this moment, not expecting any significant \nhydrologic issues.\n\n&&\n\n.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\nCT...None.\nNY...None.\nNJ...None.\nMARINE...Small Craft Advisory until 5 AM EST Tuesday for ANZ350-353-355.\n\n&&\n\n$$\n"
