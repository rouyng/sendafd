For Tuesday and Wednesday, an\ninside slider will bring strong north winds to the area along with\nlight showers across interior sections and low snow levels.\nAnother storm is expected to bring a threat of rain next weekend.\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM (TDY-WED)...12/149 PM.\n\nOverall, 12Z models in good synoptic agreement through the short\nterm period. At upper levels, low will move inland across northern\nBaja tonight with weak ridge developing over the area on Monday.\nFor Tuesday and Wednesday, cold inside slider drops into the Great\nBasin. Near the surface, west to northwest flow will prevail\nthrough Monday with moderate to strong northerly flow developing \non Tuesday and Wednesday. \n\nFor tonight/Monday, mid/high level clouds will clear out as the\nupper low moves over northern Baja. However, with a return of\nonshore flow, some stratus/fog is expected to develop tonight and\nMonday morning across the Central Coast, LAX coastal plain and\neven the Salinas River Valley. With a good onshore push through\nthe day on Monday, this low level moisture will likely keep skies\npartly cloudy west of the mountains Monday afternoon. As for\nwinds, there looks to be a brief pulse of northerly winds across\nthe Santa Ynez Range this evening. There is about a 20-30% chance\nof widespread advisory-level winds across the Santa Ynez Range.\nSo, will not issue an advisory at this time, but will make sure\nthe next shift monitors the potential closely. Otherwise, still\nlooks like some gusty southwesterly winds across the Antelope\nValley Monday afternoon and night, so will keep current WIND\nADVISORY in effect for this area. \n\nFor Monday night through Wednesday, attention turns to the impacts\nof the potent inside slider. Main concern with this system will be\nthe potential for strong and damaging northerly winds beginning\nlate Monday night and continuing through Tuesday evening. Looking\nat latest NBM numbers and ECMWF ensembles/EFI, the northerly winds\nlook to be a slight bit weaker than yesterday. However, the NBM \nstill indicates about a 70-90% chance of northerly gusts in excess\nof 65 MPH across the mountains Tuesday through Tuesday evening. \nSo, given the consistency of this scenario the last few days, will\nissue HIGH WIND WATCHES for the LA/Ventura/Santa Barbara county \nmountains (including the Santa Ynez Range) as well as the coastal \nzones south of the Santa Ynez Range and the Santa Clarita Valley. \nAt the very least, there will be widespread advisory level \nnortherly winds across many areas on Tuesday. Late Tuesday night \nand Wednesday, the winds will shift to the northeast and weaken \nbelow advisory levels. \n\nThe other concern with the inside slider will be the potential for\nsome shower activity. At this time, it looks like most of any\nmeasurable precipitation chances will be confined to the mountains\nTuesday and Tuesday night. Amounts, if any, will generally be\nunder 0.10 inches. However, snow levels drop down to around 2000\nfeet Tuesday afternoon/night. So, if any showers develop, there\ncould be some flurries or a dusting of snow across the interior\nvalleys and the Antelope Valley. Also, there could be some travel\nissues through the Grapevine Tuesday night.\n\n.LONG TERM (THU-SUN)...12/149 PM.\n\nFor the extended, 12Z models remain on the same broad synoptic\npager, but differ in the details. It's these differences that may\nimpact the forecast noticeably. \n\nFor Thursday, benign weather is expected as an upper level ridge\ndevelops over the area. Skies will start out clear, but high\nclouds (ahead of upcoming system) will be on the increase through\nthe day. Weak offshore flow will prevent any stratus development\nand will allow for some slight warming across the area.\n\nFor Friday and Saturday, both the GFS and ECMWF drop an upper low\nsouthward, off the CA coast. However, the GFS is further west with\nthe low's track than the ECMWF. So, the ECWMF solution would\nindicate a greater chance of appreciable rainfall for the area\nthan the GFS. This is also shown in the ensemble solutions with\nmany ECMWF members indicating precipitation while much fewer GFS\nensemble members indicate appreciable precipitation. Current NBM\nnumbers toe a nice middle ground for the various solutions,\nindicating chance POPs for the area Friday/Saturday. Very\npreliminary totals look to be generally around 0.25 inches or\nless. Snow levels looks to remain on the low side, generally in\nthe 2500-3500 foot range, so a few inches of snowfall will be\npossible across the mountains. \n\nFor Sunday, dry conditions are anticipated in the wake of the\nupper low. Weak offshore flow will allow for some slight warming\nfor most areas.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION...13/0013Z.\n\nAt 2303Z at KLAX there was no marine inversion.\n\nGood confidence in TAFs for KBUR, KVNY, KPMD and KWJF.\n\nModerate confidence in the following TAFs. There is a 30 percent \nchc of no low clouds at KPRB and KSMX. There is a 25 percent chc \nof IFR cigs 09Z-18Z at KSBP. There is a 30 percent chc of MVFR \ncigs 10Z-17Z at KOXR and KCMA. \n\nLow confidence in TAFs for KLAX, KLGB and KSMO where there is a \n40 percent chc of MVFR cigs 10Z-18Z.\n\nKLAX...Low confidence in the TAF. There is a 40 percent chc of\nBKN015 conds 10Z-18Z. There is 40 percent chc of an 9 kt east wind\ncomponent 08Z-18Z.\n\nKBUR...Good confidence in TAF.\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...12/1051 AM.\n\nNo changes to the marine forecast in the morning update.\n\nIn the outer waters, moderate confidence in the forecast. Winds \nwere below Small Craft Advisory (SCA) levels, but SCA level seas \ncontinued. Winds will likely come up to SCA levels again this \nafternoon. While winds will drop below SCA levels this evening, \nseas will likely remain high thru late tonight. There will be a \nbrief period of no SCA conds very late tonight/Mon morning. Then,\nNW winds will increase Mon afternoon, possibly reaching gale force\nin the northern two zones (PZZ670/673) by mid or late afternoon, \nand the southern zone by evening. Strong Gale force winds are \nexpected Mon night into Tue evening, and there is a 20-30% chance \nof STORM FORCE wind gusts Tue into Tue evening. Winds will \ndiminish below gale force late Tue night, but SCA level wind and \nseas will continue thru Wed night, with SCA level seas Thu.\n\nIn the northern inner waters, moderate confidence in the \nforecast. Seas will likely remain above SCA levels thru this \nafternoon before subsiding. There is a 20% chance of SCA level \nwinds this afternoon/evening, and a 40% chance of SCA level winds\nMon afternoon/evening. Winds and seas will likely increase to SCA\nlevels Mon night/Tue morning, then there is a good chance (50%) of\ngale force winds Tue afternoon into Tue evening. After that, SCA \nlevel winds and seas will likely persist thru Wed evening, with \nSCA level seas lingering thru at least late Wed night if not Thu.\n\nIn the southern inner waters, a brief period of SCA level W-NW\nwinds is expected in the western SBA Channel late this afternoon\nand evening. Otherwise, SCA conds are not expected thru Mon\nevening. W-NW winds are expected to reach SCA levels across\nwestern portions of the SBA Channel after midnight Mon night, \nthen overspread the rest of the inner waters Tue morning. There is\na good chance (50%) of Gale force winds across much of the SBA\nChannel and the southern inner waters Tue afternoon thru late Tue\nnight, followed by a period of SCA level winds. Conds should drop\nbelow SCA levels by Wed afternoon.\n\n&&\n\n.BEACHES...12/123 PM.\n\nThe High Surf Advisory for today has been cancelled. However, a \nlarger surf event is expected to affect the region beginning \nMonday afternoon in northern areas, then spreading southward. The \npeak of the surf is expected Tuesday and Wednesday, with surf \nheights of 14 to 18 feet and local sets to 20 feet on Central \nCoast beaches, 8 to 12 feet on west facing beaches of Ventura \nCounty and 5 to 9 feet on west facing beaches of Los Angeles \nCounty. There is a 20% chance that the surf may be large enough \nto require a High Surf Warning on the Central Coast. High surf \nwill likely continue into Wednesday night or early Thursday.\n\nAs the height of the high tides increase with the astronomical \ncycle, there will be an increasing chance of tidal overflow or \nminor coastal flooding by midweek. \n\nA HIGH SURF ADVISORY has been issued for the central coast and\nthis advisory will very likely be expanded to other coastal\nsections soon.\n\nSee LAXCFWLOX for the latest details.\n\n&&\n\n.LOX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\nCA...High Wind Watch in effect from Tuesday morning through\n      Tuesday evening for zones 53-54-59-88-349>353.
